[section:Hasher Hasher]

A type [@Hasher] implements a hash algorithm. This is used to compute the small
digests NuDB needs to effectively implement a hash table.

The NuDB database stores and retrieves key/value pairs.  This storage is
organized as "buckets" where each bucket forms the start of a linked list.
Given a key, one must caluculate which bucket it the key should be
added to. The library includes code to guarantee that any set of
keys will map to a more or less even distribution of buckets, thus
ensuring that the array of buckets is utilized efficiently.  A key
element in this code is a call to the Hasher function. This is why
the Hasher function sould be designed to generate a uniform
distribution of integers for any random collection of keys.

[heading Notation]
* `H` is a hasher class
* `h` is an instance of type `H`
* `s` is a random seed of type `std::uint64_t`
* `p` denotes a value of type `void const*`
* `n` denotes a value of type `std::size_t`

    [`H{s}`]
    [`H`]
    [
        `H` is constructed with a seed value integer `s`. To achieve resistance
        from algorithmic complexity attacks, an implementation of [*Hasher]
        should ensure that values returned from the hash function will be
        distinctly different for different values of `s`.

    [`h(p,n)`]
    [`std::uint64_t`]
    [
        Returns the digest of the memory `n` bytes in size and pointed
        to by `p`. `n` will never be zero. A good hash function will
        return values with these qualities:

* Values are uniformly distributed in the full range

* Values for the same input are distinctly different for different seeds

* Small changes in the input produce unpredictable output values

[
    [`is_Hasher<H>`]
    [`std::true_type`]
    [
        returns `std::true_type` for `H`. Otherwise returns `std::false_type`

NuDB provides the default implementation , which is
suitable for most use cases. For advanced applications, users may
supply their own implementation which fulfills the above requirements.
